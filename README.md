## Introduction

Welcome to Legendary Inspiration! A gallery of inspirational images and quotes to fill your cup.  Interact and 
save your favorites.  Create your own inspirational poster. Allow these beautiful words to brighten your day!

## Set Up

2. Clone down your new, forked repo

## Technologies

For this project, we used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Our primary focus was on JavaScript as the HTML and CSS were provided by 
Turing School of Software and Design.  We used paired programming to complete this project.  As such, commits from either one of us were prepared by both of us.
